# Starlib Rate Library
The nuclear physics library for astrophysical research that can be accessed here is called STARLIB, which is described in detail in this publication. STARLIB has a number of unique features: (i) it is a tabular library listing reaction rates (cm3mol-1s-1) and decay (s-1) constants on a grid of temperatures between 1 MK and 10 GK; (ii) it incorporates a recent evaluation of Monte Carlo based thermonuclear reaction rates; (iii) it provides at each temperature, in addition to a recommended reaction rate or decay constant, the associated factor uncertainty and probability density function. You can download the entire library or a subset thereof, or you can simply look up the rates for a given nuclear process. The heaviest nuclide contained in the present version of STARLIBv01 is 180Xe.
